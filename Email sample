Subject: Boost Your Productivity with GitHub Copilot – Start Using It Today!

Dear Team,

We have access to GitHub Copilot, a powerful AI-driven coding assistant designed to streamline development and boost productivity. However, we have observed that while many have taken the license, active engagement remains low. To fully leverage its potential, we encourage everyone—including new joiners and fresh graduates—to integrate GitHub Copilot with their preferred IDE and use it actively in daily work.

Why Use GitHub Copilot?

✔ Accelerate Development – Generate code snippets, complete functions, and reduce boilerplate coding.
✔ Improve Code Quality – Get instant suggestions and improve logic with AI-powered recommendations.
✔ Enhance Learning – Understand best practices, explore new coding patterns, and write efficient code.
✔ Simplify Repetitive Tasks – Automate routine coding work and focus on solving complex problems.

Call to Action

1. For Those Who Haven't Started – If you haven't integrated GitHub Copilot yet, please set it up in your IDE and start using it.


2. For Those with Low Activity – If you've taken the license but haven’t been using it regularly, we encourage you to explore its features and experience the impact firsthand.


3. For New Joiners & Fresh Graduates – This is a great opportunity to enhance your coding skills and increase efficiency from day one!



Your active engagement will not only help you but also contribute to improving our department’s overall usage metrics. Let's increase the percentage of engaged users and make the most of this valuable tool.

If you need any guidance on setup or best practices, feel free to reach out. Looking forward to seeing more developers benefiting from GitHub Copilot!
