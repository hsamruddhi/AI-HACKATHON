Thanks for taking the time to talk, I really appreciate all the support and opportunities I’ve got so far.
Over the past year, I’ve taken up more responsibilities and handled tasks that are already at the next level. I feel I’ve grown a lot in this role and have been adding good value to the team and the work we do.
That’s why I want to request a promotion now, along with a fair salary hike that matches the work and ownership I’ve been taking.
I also wanted to share that this timing is important for me. In the next few months, I’ll be focusing on some personal priorities, so this is the right time for me to step into the new role and gain the experience and exposure that comes with it. If it gets delayed, I might lose the chance to get that hands-on experience, and it may get harder to balance later.
My goal is to continue performing well and contribute even more. The promotion will help me stay motivated and focused, and I’ll make sure it reflects in my work and results.
I hope you’ll consider this positively — I really want to grow within the team and take on more responsibility.



------
Based on my performance and the responsibilities I’m already handling, I believe I’m already operating at the next level. I’ve taken ownership beyond my current role — whether it’s in delivery, collaboration, or problem-solving — and I’m confident that I can continue adding value at that higher capacity.

“Given that, I’d like to request a promotion aligned with a fair hike that reflects the level of contribution and responsibility I’m already managing. I see this as the right step for both recognition and motivation going forward.”

If the promotion gets delayed, I might lose the opportunity to gain that experience and fully prepare myself for higher responsibilities in the future.
