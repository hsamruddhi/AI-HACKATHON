Great context. Since you’re presenting to a senior Head of Department, the demo should feel real, end-to-end, and business-relevant, not like scattered features.
Below is one strong use case you can use throughout the entire demo, and then I’ll map Copilot features step-by-step on top of it — exactly suited for Java + Spring Boot in IntelliJ IDEA.
🔹 Single Use Case for Entire Demo (Recommended)
Use Case: “Build a Trade Search REST API with Validation, Error Handling, Tests, and SQL”
Why this works well for leadership:
Very close to real enterprise development
Shows productivity, code quality, and developer acceleration
Naturally allows you to showcase multiple Copilot features
Easy to understand even for non-coding senior leaders
🔹 Business Problem (Explain in 30 seconds)
“We need to expose a REST API that allows clients to search trade records based on dynamic criteria like tradeId, batchId, date range, and status.
The API must be performant, validated, well-tested, and production-ready.”
🔹 Demo Flow (Use This Same Flow End-to-End)
You start with an empty or minimal Spring Boot project and let Copilot assist you at every step.
🧩 Step-by-Step Copilot Features You Can Cover
1️⃣ Code Generation (From Comment / Intent)
What you show:
Open a new Controller class
Write a high-level comment
Let Copilot generate code
Example:
Copy code
Java
// REST controller to search trades based on dynamic criteria
// Supports tradeId, batchId, status, and date range
👉 Copilot generates:
@RestController
@PostMapping("/trades/search")
Request DTO usage
🎯 Feature Highlighted
Natural language → working code
Faster scaffolding
Reduced boilerplate
🗣️ What to tell HOD:
“Instead of remembering annotations and patterns, developers focus on intent. Copilot fills in the structure.”
2️⃣ DTO & Validation Generation
What you do:
Create TradeSearchRequest
Write a small hint
Copy code
Java
// Request object for trade search with validation
👉 Copilot suggests:
Fields
@NotNull, @Size
Date fields
Enums
🎯 Features
Best-practice validation
Consistent DTOs
Fewer bugs early
🗣️ Leadership angle:
“Validation is often skipped under pressure. Copilot nudges developers toward better quality by default.”
3️⃣ Service Layer Logic (Business Code)
What you show:
Create TradeService
Write method signature
Let Copilot suggest implementation logic
Copy code
Java
public List<Trade> searchTrades(TradeSearchRequest request) {
👉 Copilot helps with:
Conditional logic
Clean readable code
Guard clauses
🎯 Features
Context-aware suggestions
Code consistency
Cleaner logic
4️⃣ Repository + SQL / JPA Query Assistance
Option A: JPA Criteria / Specification
Option B (Better impact): Native SQL / JPQL
Copy code
Java
// Build dynamic query based on provided search criteria
👉 Copilot helps:
Build query structure
Avoid unnecessary ORs
Suggest LEFT JOINs
Handle optional parameters
🎯 Features
SQL generation
Query optimization hints
Less trial-and-error
🗣️ HOD takeaway:
“This reduces time spent debugging queries and improves performance awareness.”
5️⃣ Inline Chat – “Explain This Code”
What you do:
Select a complex method
Right-click → Copilot Chat → Explain
👉 Copilot explains:
What the method does
Edge cases
Logic flow
🎯 Features
Knowledge sharing
Faster onboarding
Reduced dependency on senior devs
🗣️ Leadership angle:
“This shortens the learning curve for new hires.”
6️⃣ Error Fixing (Realistic Scenario)
What you show:
Introduce a small bug or compilation error
Ask Copilot Chat:
“Fix this error and explain why it occurred”
👉 Copilot:
Fixes imports / generics
Explains root cause
🎯 Features
Faster debugging
Contextual fixes
Learning while fixing
7️⃣ Unit Test Generation (High Impact for Leaders)
What you do:
Open TradeService
Ask Copilot:
Copy code
Text
Generate JUnit tests for this service covering success and edge cases
👉 Copilot generates:
JUnit 5 tests
Mockito usage
Multiple scenarios
🎯 Features
Test coverage improvement
Quality by default
Massive time saver
🗣️ HOD angle:
“Better test coverage directly reduces production incidents.”
8️⃣ Code Review & Refactoring
What you show:
Select a method
Ask:
“Simplify this code and suggest improvements”
👉 Copilot:
Removes duplication
Improves readability
Suggests better naming
🎯 Features
Built-in reviewer
Enforces clean code
Less review overhead
9️⃣ Documentation / Comments Generation
Copy code
Text
Add JavaDoc for this API and service method
👉 Copilot generates:
Clear JavaDocs
Parameter descriptions
🎯 Features
Better maintainability
Less forgotten documentation
🎤 How to Position This to HOD (Very Important)
Key Messages to Repeat:
🚀 Faster delivery (less boilerplate)
🛡️ Better quality (tests, validation, reviews)
📚 Faster onboarding
🔄 Consistency across teams
🧠 Developers focus on logic, not syntax
🧾 Features You Can Explicitly List in Slides
You can safely say you covered:
Code generation from comments
Inline suggestions
Copilot Chat (Explain / Fix / Refactor)
Test generation
SQL & query assistance
Error resolution
Documentation generation
Code review assistance
⭐ Final Recommendation
Use only ONE use case.
Repeat this line during demo:
“This is the same real-life task we do daily — Copilot is just accelerating each step.”
If you want, next I can:
Create a 10-minute demo script
Give exact Copilot prompts to use live
Help you prepare HOD-level talking points (non-technical)
Just tell me 👍
