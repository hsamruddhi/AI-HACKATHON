#githubRepo Clone repository (GITHUB_REPO_URL) into the local workspace. Create branch (JIRA ID] from the default remote branch and set upstream. Push the new branch (JIRA ID> to origin.
#jira_query (JIRA_ID) Explain the story scope and acceptance criteria, then implement the required changes in (GITHUB REPO NAME)
#githubRepo Review local changes on branch (JIRA_ID): run unit tests, linters/formatters, static analysis, and show a unified diff of all modified files for verification before pushing commits to GitHub.
#githubRepo Commit all validated changes to branch JIRA_ID) using commit message "JIRA_ID) - <commit message>" only
#githubRepo Push the latest commits on branch JIRA ID> to origin
#githubRepo Create and submit a final pull request from JIRA ID] to the repository's default branch. Use PR title "(JIRA_ID) - <commit message>" anc include a link to the Jira story
#jira_query (JIRA_ID) Update the story with implementation notes, attach the PR link, and transition the ticket to In Review

Agentic AI, powered by VS Code Copilot Pro extensions, acts like an intelligent development assistant that connects with tools like Jira, GitHub, Confluence, Promptbook, and others to understand requirements and automatically perform real development tasks across the lifecycle.”

The statistics on this slide show real industry results — faster development, better code quality, and significant time savings for developers. So this is not just about coding faster; it’s about delivering business features quicker, reducing effort, and improving overall productivity.”

Today, we’ll see how we can go from a blank starting point to a fully implemented, tested, and documented solution based on a Jira story. Instead of manually handling every step, we’ll explore how AI can assist throughout the entire development lifecycle.
The goal of this session is to demonstrate how we can reduce repetitive manual work, save development time, and improve overall productivity by leveraging automated, AI-driven workflows.
At a high level, the AI agent will understand the requirement, analyze the codebase, suggest implementation changes, and help us move faster from requirement to delivery.

The results shown here highlight the real productivity gains:
Faster development cycles (~55% improvement)
30–40% reduction in repetitive coding effort
Better code quality and fewer defects
Faster pull request merges
Significant automation of documentation and repetitive tasks
Nearly 1 hour saved per developer per day
