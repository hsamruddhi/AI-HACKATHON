#My Journey at HHHH: From a Graduate Trainee to an Award-Winning Consultant Specialist

Success is not just about reaching a milestone; it’s about the journey that shapes you. As I sit down to reflect on my 5+ years at HHHH, I can’t help but feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude and pride for how far I’ve come—from joining as a fresh graduate trainee to earning the title of Consultant Specialist.

Recently, I had the honor of winning the ACE Award at the RTI Annual Event 2024—a moment that celebrated not just my work but my dedication, resilience, and passion for technology.

But this achievement didn’t happen overnight. It’s the result of years of hard work, learning, and pushing boundaries—both personal and professional. And today, I want to share that journey with you.

Defining Moments: Turning Challenges into Opportunities

Every success story has defining moments, and mine is no different. Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of working on cutting-edge projects that challenged my abilities and tested my limits. Each project presented a unique opportunity to innovate, automate, and deliver solutions that added tangible value.

I immersed myself in learning advanced technologies—whether it was data engineering frameworks, AI/ML solutions, or enterprise systems. What started as curiosity quickly turned into expertise, enabling me to solve complex problems with confidence. These experiences not only shaped my technical skills but also gave me the ability to think strategically and execute flawlessly.

One key milestone that stands out was when we successfully delivered a high-impact project, reducing manual efforts by 40% through automation. It reinforced my belief that smart work, combined with dedication, always pays off.

Another defining project was the migration of multiple regulatory reporting systems (MAS, ESMA, JFSA, FCA, ASIC, MAS Re-Write) to a modern platform—RRRR. This platform now processes 200 million+ events daily across 20+ jurisdictions. I played a key role in designing and building a scalable and efficient system, ensuring seamless regulatory compliance and transforming reporting operations.

Behind the Success: Discipline, Focus, and Passion

I often get asked, “What’s the secret behind your success?” My answer is simple—consistency and focus. I’ve always believed that success is a result of daily habits. Whether it’s setting clear goals, staying organized, or constantly upskilling, I’ve made it a point to give my 100% to every task.

My motto in life has always been:
“Stay curious, stay committed, and success will follow.”

This mindset has kept me grounded and driven, even when faced with setbacks.

Lessons Learned: Embracing Failures as Stepping Stones

Failures are often disguised as opportunities in work clothes, and my journey has had its fair share of them. From missed deadlines to technical roadblocks, I’ve learned that failures are not the end—they’re just lessons waiting to be learned.

One such instance involved a critical deliverable that required quick thinking and late-night debugging sessions. While the process was exhausting, it taught me the importance of resilience, teamwork, and problem-solving under pressure.

These lessons have shaped me into someone who doesn’t fear obstacles but instead sees them as challenges to conquer.

The Power of Mentorship: Support That Made a Difference

Behind every successful person is a strong support system, and I’m no exception. I’m deeply thankful for the mentors, seniors, and teammates who guided and supported me throughout my journey.

I’ve had the privilege of learning from ABC, XYZ, PQR, LMN, and many others, whose collaboration and guidance during critical projects taught me the value of teamwork, adaptability, and shared learning.

Our Head of Department has been a constant source of inspiration, encouraging me to think bigger, innovate fearlessly, and push my boundaries. Their visionary leadership and focus on excellence have deeply influenced my growth, motivating me to adopt a solution-driven mindset.

I’m also grateful to my seniors, who consistently recognized and celebrated my contributions, from project delivery to process innovations. Their acknowledgments—through awards like Star Performer, Pat on the Back, and the prestigious ACE Award—have reinforced my drive to set higher standards and deliver impactful results.

Their belief in my potential has not only shaped my career but also instilled the confidence to take ownership and lead with purpose and passion.

Balancing Ambition with Well-being: Work Smart, Not Just Hard

Many people assume that winning an award means sacrificing personal life, but I firmly believe in balance. While I worked hard to achieve professional milestones, I also made time for family, health, and hobbies.

From weekend getaways to early morning yoga sessions and spending time with friends, I ensured my work-life balance never took a backseat. After all, a healthy mind and body fuel creativity and productivity.

It’s this balance that allowed me to give my best without feeling burned out, proving that success doesn’t come from overworking; it comes from working smart.

The Road Ahead: Aspiring for More

Winning the ACE Award has been a motivating milestone, but it’s just the beginning. My aspirations go beyond awards—I aim to leverage AI/ML technologies to simplify workflows and create solutions that are scalable and impactful.

I’m also deeply committed to inspiring women in technology and breaking barriers in the corporate world. My goal is to become one of the youngest leaders in HHHH, both technically and functionally skilled, paving the way for others to dream big.

I often look up to successful women who’ve shattered ceilings at a young age, proving that age is no barrier when ambition is fueled by hard work. Their stories inspire me to dream bigger and work harder.
