Below is a short, spoken demo script you can use, followed by additional Agentic Mode use cases that work very well in a live demo.
🎤 Short Script: GitHub Copilot Agentic Mode Demo (3–5 minutes)
Intro (30 sec)
“Today I’ll demonstrate GitHub Copilot Agentic Mode, where Copilot acts less like autocomplete and more like a software development agent.
Instead of giving line-by-line suggestions, it understands a goal, plans steps, and executes changes across the codebase.”
Example 1: Generate Codebase Using Agent (1 min)
“Let me start with a high-level task.”
Prompt:
‘Create a RESTful Spring Boot application with user management, JWT authentication, and basic CRUD APIs.’
“What Copilot Agent does now is:
Scans the workspace
Plans the architecture
Creates controllers, services, entities
Adds dependencies and configuration
This is similar to how a junior developer would scaffold a project end-to-end.”
Example 2: Agentic Code Review (45 sec)
“Next, I’ll ask Copilot to review existing code.”
Prompt:
‘Review this service layer for performance, security, and best practices.’
“Copilot Agent:
Reads multiple files
Identifies code smells
Suggests refactoring
Flags potential bugs and security issues
This goes beyond linting—it’s a contextual code review.”
Example 3: Refactoring Across Files (45 sec)
“Now let’s try refactoring.”
Prompt:
‘Refactor this application to follow clean architecture and reduce duplication.’
“The agent updates multiple files consistently, adjusts imports, and explains why changes were made.”
Wrap-up (30 sec)
“Agentic Mode shows how Copilot is evolving from an assistant to a collaborative developer—planning, executing, and validating work, while we stay in control.”
🔥 Other Strong Agentic Mode Use Cases You Can Showcase
These are high-impact and demo-friendly:
1️⃣ Test Generation & Fixing
Prompt:
‘Generate unit and integration tests and fix any failing ones.’
Why it’s powerful:
Writes tests
Runs them
Fixes code if tests fail
2️⃣ Legacy Code Modernization
Prompt:
‘Migrate this Java 8 code to Java 17 and update deprecated APIs.’
Shows:
Multi-file reasoning
API understanding
Enterprise relevance
3️⃣ Documentation Agent
Prompt:
‘Generate README and API documentation for this project.’
Great for:
New projects
Onboarding demos
4️⃣ Bug Reproduction & Fix
Prompt:
‘Reproduce this NullPointerException and fix it with a test case.’
Shows:
Debugging
Root cause analysis
Validation
5️⃣ Security Hardening
Prompt:
‘Identify security vulnerabilities and apply fixes.’
Highlights:
Secure coding
Enterprise readiness
6️⃣ CI/CD Assistance
Prompt:
‘Create a GitHub Actions pipeline with build, test, and security scan.’
Demonstrates:
Tool usage
DevOps integration
⭐ Best Combo for a Short Demo (Recommended)
If time is limited, show only 3:
Codebase generation
Agentic code review
Test generation & auto-fix
This clearly proves agentic behavior.
If you want, I can:
Create ready-to-copy demo prompts
Write a 1-minute executive version
Tailor it specifically for Java / Python / Microservices
