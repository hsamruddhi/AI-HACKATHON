Generate a nice documents and citation for pioneer of the quarter award.

I need you to take care of these points to make the content impressive:

1. Operational resilence


2. Moving various jurisdictions to future state architecture


3. Cost optimization by using variois innovation and optimisation which simplifies products/services ultimately reducing the cost


4. DATA strategy (data architecture that system adhrmere to, to have high quality data assests accesiblw to users)


5. Monitoring observability innovations



These are some contributions done by me on which you have create a nice content for the award :

1. Work on Data strategy :



iceberge table dynamic compaction

optimization of iceberge tables for betterr performance.

building robust Monitoring and alerting on Iceberg metadata tables( which is not being done by any team in fdr)


Benifits observed :
Provided both i/o savings and processing times.
Optmized query execution
Efficient mermtadata management

2. Helped in building and providing DROIT report integrated with complex dremio queries for execution.
(Here i have extracted regulatory reports , validated it, process/transform it to generate the ACK NACK reprlort3out if it. I have written complex dremio queries where i had to flatten the data, use various transform functions to convert result into json, extract few fieldsfrom json, etc. This utiluty is being by Ops people flawlessly.)


3. Worked on implementing the hashi vault changes to rrcp, ensuring secure storage mangement and sensitive information.
Did few POC around it to know how it fits and easily adopts into our system .


4. Enhancement on monitoring and aleting



finding apps and aleting which are having heap overhead memory issue at
runtime

kubernetes resource monitoring.
-infrastructure monitoring and alerting

generated various dashboard for easy monitoringh various processes and get insights on issues.


5. Taken multiple sessions wiyh wider audience within and outside department for knowledge sharing on :



Obervabiluty, monitoring,  aletting infra tooling setup

Data strategy

Data improvement

Hashi Vault

proactive usage on github copilot.


I am good with handling multiple tasks, issues . I have taken ownership of various flows in RRCP. and has completed the task without missing a deadline.
Good in analyzing and resolution of errors. Proactively worked on  other items for knowledge gain apart from BAU WORK.
Helped team cross pod despite of tight deadlines. I have even got HTI Level award for execellemce for showcasing my outstanding work at hsbc in 2024 December,  in hti annual award, india.

I am also contributing in AI and innovations solutions.

Based on these write nice content for award nomination and try to add numbers( in percentage ) which showcases improvement,  cost reduction,  etc. Yiu can write extra content as well to make it more impresseive..
