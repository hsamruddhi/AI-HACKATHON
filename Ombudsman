4.  The reimbursement claim of ₹1,01,694 for my mother’s right ureter calculus surgery was rejected by HDFC ERGO Insurance Company on the ground that the hospital was on their excluded list. Prior to the surgery, I had informed the company about the hospital and surgery, and they created a claim ID and guided me with the document submission process without raising any objection (refer attached email communication). Had the insurer informed me at that stage about the exclusion, I would have taken corrective action. Instead, they communicated the exclusion only at the final stage of reimbursementsettlement, causing me financial loss. This conduct is unfair and against the interest of a customer who pays premiums on time with the expectation of support in emergencies.

10.
(a) The matter was earlier raised with the HDFC ERGO Grievance Team and subsequently escalated to IRDAI. Multiple emails and calls with the customer care team were made, but each time, I only received a brief AI-Bot response along with the same repudiation letter attached, without any satisfactory resolution of the issue.

(b) Not applicable, as representation was duly made. Since the issue remained unresolved, I have now approached the Insurance Ombudsman for relief.
