Here is your updated script with “HSBC” replaced by “ABC”, keeping everything else exactly the same and cleanly formatted for direct use:
Perfect — this actually makes your demo much stronger because now you are showing true Agentic execution with ONE intent-driven prompt instead of multiple commands.
Below is your UPDATED READY-TO-SPEAK SCRIPT where:
✅ You explain Jira first (business context)
✅ Identify impacted repo like a real developer
✅ Then run ONE MASTER PROMPT
✅ Agent executes full SDLC workflow autonomously
🎤 UPDATED DEMO SCRIPT (Developer Story → One Prompt Execution)
🟢 0:00 – 2:00 | Opening Hook
Say:
“Good morning everyone.
Let me start with a simple question — when you start working on a Jira story, what is the first thing you do?”
(wait)
“You read the ticket, understand scope, find the right repository, create a branch, implement changes, test, create PR, and update Jira.”
Pause.
“Today I’ll show how GitHub Copilot Agentic AI together with ABC PRO extension can execute this entire workflow from a single instruction.”
🟢 2:00 – 4:00 | What Makes Agent Mode Different
Open Copilot Agent panel.
Say:
“Traditional AI helps write code.
Agentic AI understands intent and executes multi-step workflows using enterprise tools like Jira and GitHub.”
“Think of this as assigning a task to a developer — not asking for code snippets.”
🟢 4:00 – 7:00 | Step 1 — Start From Jira (Business First)
👉 Open Jira ticket.
Say:
“Let’s begin exactly how developers work — from the Jira story.”
Read key lines briefly.
Then explain in your own words:
“This story requires us to implement [short functional summary].”
Point to acceptance criteria.
“Acceptance criteria clearly mention:
condition A
validation B
expected behavior C”
Now transition naturally:
“Next question every developer asks — which repository owns this change?”
🟢 7:00 – 8:30 | Identify Repository
Show repo name.
Say:
“Based on service ownership, these changes belong to the [REPO NAME] repository.”
“Normally now I would clone repo, create branch, and start implementation manually.”
Pause.
Smile slightly.
“Instead… I’ll assign this entire task to the Agent.”
🟢 8:30 – 9:30 | Explain What Will Happen (Build Anticipation)
Before running prompt:
“With a single instruction, the agent will:
set up repository and branch
understand Jira requirements
implement code changes
run validations
create commits and PR
and finally update Jira.”
🔥 This prepares audience for automation.
🟢 9:30 – 18:00 | THE ONE MASTER PROMPT (Main WOW Moment)
Paste and run your combined prompt.
While agent works, narrate continuously:
When cloning starts:
“First, the agent prepares the workspace — cloning repository and creating a Jira-based branch following team conventions.”
When Jira analysis appears:
“Now it’s interpreting the Jira story — extracting scope and acceptance criteria before coding.”
KEY LINE:
“Notice I didn’t explain the codebase. The agent is building its own understanding.”
During implementation:
“The agent is now locating impacted files and implementing changes aligned with requirements.”
“This is autonomous navigation of the codebase — similar to how an experienced developer explores unfamiliar modules.”
During validation:
“Before committing anything, it performs developer-quality checks — unit tests, linting, and static analysis.”
“So AI is not just generating code, it is validating responsibility.”
During commit & push:
“Commits follow standardized Jira-linked messaging automatically — important for enterprise traceability.”
During PR creation:
(Slow down voice)
“Now it prepares the pull request with context, change summary, and Jira linkage.”
Pause intentionally.
During Jira update:
“And finally — updating implementation notes and moving the story to In Review.”
Let audience see Jira transition.
🟢 18:00 – 21:00 | Pause & Emphasize Impact
Say slowly:
“From requirement understanding to PR submission — executed from a single instruction.”
Ask audience:
“How many manual steps did we just skip?”
Let responses come.
🟢 21:00 – 24:00 | Developer Perspective Explanation
“The real value here is not faster coding.
It’s removing context switching.”
Highlight verbally:
✅ No manual Git operations
✅ No copying Jira details
✅ No PR drafting
✅ No manual ticket updates
🟢 24:00 – 27:00 | Interactive Discussion
Ask:
“Would you start delegating repetitive tasks like this?”
“Where would this help most — feature work or bug fixes?”
🟢 27:00 – 30:00 | Closing Line (Memorable Ending)
“We are moving from AI-assisted coding to AI-executed development workflows.”
Pause.
“The developer defines intent — the agent handles execution.”
Thank audience.
⭐ VERY IMPORTANT DELIVERY TIP
When you run the single prompt, lean back slightly and stop typing.
That body language subconsciously tells audience:
👉 “Now the AI is working.”
It dramatically increases the impact.
If you want, I can next give you a super-short 1-minute backup script in case time runs short but you still want a strong ending.
