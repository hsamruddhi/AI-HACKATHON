Here’s an analysis of the disadvantages of using POC 2 compared to POC 1, with a focus on service maturity aspects, integration challenges, and gaps in monitoring, alerting, and data handling.

1. Challenges in Integration with POC 1’s Pipeline

Pipeline Compatibility:

POC 1 has a well-established pipeline that supports complex processes like observability, CI/CD, integration testing, regression, and replay publisher mechanisms.

POC 2’s centralized UC flattening design introduces a monolithic or semi-monolithic architecture that could disrupt POC 1’s distributed microservices approach.

The event-based message flow of POC 1 (UC Msg → Event Msg) is tightly coupled with its microservices architecture, which might not align with POC 2’s flat UC terms model. Adapting POC 2 to POC 1’s pipeline will require significant reengineering.


Data Transformation Gaps:

POC 1 handles complex transformations (e.g., snapping, archiving, and Dremio views generation) using specialized microservices. POC 2 might not provide these capabilities, requiring additional middleware or services to bridge this gap.

Replay publishers and search functionality in POC 1 depend on robust data handling pipelines, which may not be inherently supported in POC 2.

2. Service Maturity Scenarios Not Covered in POC 2

Observability and Monitoring:

POC 1 includes mature observability with monitoring and alerting capabilities for microservices. POC 2’s centralized design lacks clarity on how these observability aspects will be implemented.

Alerting mechanisms for failures in data flow, pipeline performance, and service health are well-defined in POC 1 but appear underdeveloped in POC 2.


Testing and CI/CD:

POC 1 supports robust testing frameworks (integration, regression, and end-to-end testing), which are essential for a productionized system.

POC 2’s centralized approach might complicate CI/CD processes as it introduces dependencies on a single centralized component, increasing the risk of bottlenecks.


Scalability and Flexibility:

POC 1’s non-monolithic microservices design inherently supports horizontal scaling and individual service upgrades.

POC 2’s centralized design may introduce challenges in scaling individual components without impacting the whole system.


Service Decoupling:

POC 1 benefits from the loosely coupled nature of microservices, allowing independent development, deployment, and scaling of services.

POC 2’s centralized component could become a single point of failure, reducing the resilience and fault-tolerance of the system.

3. Monitoring, Alerting, and Data Handling Activities Not Covered in POC 2

Monitoring and Alerting:

POC 2 lacks clarity on the implementation of:

Service-level health monitoring.

Real-time alerting for anomalies in UC term provisioning.

Distributed tracing for pinpointing failures in the pipeline.



Data Handling:

POC 1 supports sophisticated data operations like snapping, archiving, and Dremio views generation, which are absent in POC 2. Implementing these in POC 2 would require additional layers, increasing complexity.

Data consistency and reconciliation mechanisms in POC 1 may not be fully supported in POC 2’s centralized design.


Replay and Recovery:

POC 1 supports replay publishers to handle data reprocessing and recovery scenarios effectively.

POC 2 lacks clarity on how it will address replay and recovery, especially given the centralized nature of UC term provisioning.

Conclusion

While POC 2’s centralized design simplifies UC term provisioning, it introduces significant challenges in integration with POC 1’s pipeline. Key service maturity aspects like monitoring, observability, scalability, and robust data handling are underdeveloped in POC 2. Adapting POC 2 to match POC 1’s maturity and integration requirements will demand substantial effort, including reengineering pipelines, enhancing monitoring, and addressing data handling gaps.
