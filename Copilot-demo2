Perfect. Below is a crisp, 10-minute, leadership-friendly demo script with exact Copilot prompts you can copy-paste or speak live.
It’s structured so you never switch context and always stay within one use case (Trade Search API).
Tone is professional and polished, suitable for a Head of Department.
🕒 10-Minute GitHub Copilot Live Demo Script
Use Case: Build a Trade Search REST API (Java + Spring Boot)
IDE: IntelliJ IDEA
⏱️ Minute 0–1: Opening (Context Setting)
What you say:
“I’ll demonstrate how GitHub Copilot assists a developer in day-to-day work using one realistic use case.
We’ll build a Trade Search API step by step, and Copilot will assist at every stage — from code generation to testing and debugging.”
⏱️ Minute 1–2: Controller Creation (Intent → Code)
Action:
Create TradeSearchController.java
Type this comment:
Copy code
Java
// REST controller to search trades based on dynamic criteria
// Supports search by tradeId, batchId, status, and date range
Wait → Accept Copilot suggestion
What Copilot generates (approx):
@RestController
@RequestMapping
@PostMapping
Method signature
Say:
“Instead of writing boilerplate, I describe intent. Copilot generates a production-ready controller structure instantly.”
⏱️ Minute 2–3: Request DTO + Validation
Create: TradeSearchRequest.java
Type:
Copy code
Java
// Request DTO for trade search with validation annotations
Accept suggestions
Copilot generates:
Fields
@NotNull, @Size
LocalDate ranges
Enum fields
Say:
“Copilot applies best practices by default, such as validation, which directly improves API reliability.”
⏱️ Minute 3–4: Service Layer Logic
Create: TradeService.java
Type:
Copy code
Java
public List<Trade> searchTrades(TradeSearchRequest request) {
Let Copilot continue
Say:
“Copilot understands project context and writes readable business logic instead of just syntactically correct code.”
⏱️ Minute 4–5: Repository + SQL Assistance
Open Repository Interface
Type comment:
Copy code
Java
// Fetch trades dynamically based on optional search criteria
OR ask via Copilot Chat (recommended for impact):
📌 Copilot Chat Prompt:
Copy code
Text
Generate a JPA repository method or native SQL query
to search trades using optional parameters:
tradeId, batchId, status, fromDate, toDate.
Avoid unnecessary OR conditions.
Say:
“This reduces time spent crafting and debugging SQL and improves query quality.”
⏱️ Minute 5–6: Explain Code (Knowledge Sharing)
Select a complex method
Copilot Chat Prompt:
Copy code
Text
Explain this method in simple terms and list edge cases handled.
Say:
“This is extremely useful for onboarding, handovers, and code reviews.”
⏱️ Minute 6–7: Error Fixing (Live Scenario)
Introduce a small error (wrong import / missing return)
Copilot Chat Prompt:
Copy code
Text
Fix the compilation error and explain why it occurred.
Say:
“Developers fix issues faster while learning from the explanation.”
⏱️ Minute 7–8: Unit Test Generation (High Leadership Impact)
Open TradeService
Copilot Chat Prompt:
Copy code
Text
Generate JUnit 5 tests for this service.
Cover valid input, empty results, and invalid request scenarios.
Use Mockito where required.
Say:
“Test creation, which often gets delayed, becomes almost effortless.”
⏱️ Minute 8–9: Refactoring & Code Review
Select a method
Copilot Chat Prompt:
Copy code
Text
Refactor this method to improve readability and maintainability.
Optional Prompt:
Copy code
Text
Review this code and suggest improvements as part of a code review.
Say:
“Copilot acts like a second reviewer, helping maintain consistent code quality.”
⏱️ Minute 9–10: Documentation & Wrap-Up
Copilot Chat Prompt:
Copy code
Text
Add JavaDoc for this controller and service method.
Closing Statement:
“This was one everyday development task.
Copilot didn’t replace decision-making — it accelerated execution, improved quality, and reduced repetitive effort.”
🎯 Summary Slide (What You Covered)
You can confidently say you demonstrated:
Code generation from natural language
Inline suggestions
Copilot Chat (Explain / Fix / Refactor)
SQL & repository assistance
Unit test generation
Error resolution
Code review support
Documentation generation
💡 Final Tip for Live Demo
Keep Copilot Chat docked and say:
“This is how developers actually use Copilot daily — not as magic, but as an intelligent assistant.”
If you want next, I can:
Create backup prompts in case suggestions don’t appear
Give a 1-slide executive summary
Help you practice a 30-second closing pitch
Just say the word.

Act as a senior Java backend developer.

Create a production-ready Spring Boot application that exposes a REST API to search trades.

Requirements:
- Use Spring Boot, Java 17, and standard Spring best practices
- Expose a POST REST endpoint: /api/trades/search
- Accept a request body with optional search criteria:
  tradeId, batchId, status, fromDate, toDate
- Apply input validation using Jakarta validation annotations
- Implement a layered architecture:
  Controller → Service → Repository
- Use JPA with a dynamic query (JPQL or Criteria API) to handle optional parameters efficiently
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes and meaningful responses
- Add global exception handling using @ControllerAdvice
- Include clean logging and JavaDoc for public methods
- Generate unit tests for the service layer using JUnit 5 and Mockito

Follow clean code principles and enterprise standards.
